Welcome to my portfolio repository! Here you'll find a collection of my projects, documenting my journey through 42 Lisboa and showcasing my skills as a software developer.

## About Me
I'm a software developer with a focus on C, and I'm also familiar with C++, C#, Python, and JavaScript. Currently studying Computer Science at 42 Lisboa.
Outside of coding, I enjoy gaming, working on personal programming projects, and exploring topics like futurism, astronomy, and philosophy.
Feel free to explore each project folder for more details, including code snippets, documentation, and any additional resources.
